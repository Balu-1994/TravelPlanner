# TravelPlanner
<h1>Welcome to the Travel Planner project!</h1>
Thank you for your interest on this small project repository that we hope you will enjoy using. This README document is a summary of what we (the coders) are going to do on this project. The following points describe the main characteristics of this project:
The goal is to create a travel planner program to help users organize and plan their trips and eventual future ones for optimization.
<ul><li>This is a collaborator free and open project as anyone can participate and input their trip details into the program for more accurate and efficient recommendations.</li>
<li>This is also the first python project for the coders to get a first insight on working on a larger scale coding project by acquiring skills and background for complementation.</li>
<li>The program will be useful for anyone who wants to plan a trip and manage their budget accordingly to that said trip. In return this program will help users visualize their trip details by suggesting a planned timeline according to their demands and giving a breakdown of expenses for their budget trip.</li>
</ul>
More updates and details will come soon as this is only the start of the project, check the file ROADMAP.md for more details on milestones and tasks planned.
