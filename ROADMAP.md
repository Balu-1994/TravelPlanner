Advanced Python project: Travel Planner
Name: TravelPlanner
Coders: Balagopal Rajagopal, James Kai Groff Mizoguchi
Mission and summary: Create a travel planner program to help users organize and plan their trips and eventual future ones for optimization. 

The following milestones are set as such for this project with the deadlines in italics:

1.	Project management – April 27th, 2023
2.	First deliverable; GitHub – May 4th, 2023
3.	Second deliverable; Classes; Refactoring – May 11th ,2023
4.	Third deliverable; Unit tests; Issues – May 18th, 2023
5.	Virtual environment – May 25th, 2023
6.	Presentation (in person and in class) – June 1st, 2023

It will be separated in those different tasks:

Task 1 - Trip Details and Itinerary
Allow users to input trip details, such as destination, dates, transportation, and accommodations. Users can also add activities or points of interest to their itinerary.

Task 2 - Budget Management
Enable users to input their trip budget and track expenses, such as accommodation costs, transportation, meals, and activities. Provide a way to view the remaining budget and suggest adjustments if necessary.

Task 3 - Data Visualization and Trip Analysis
Provide users with visualizations of their trip data, such as a timeline of planned activities or a breakdown of expenses by category. Allow users to analyse their travel patterns and budget usage to optimize future trips.
This is a weekly-based working program, so the timeframe for this project will be taken care of according to the deadlines of the milestones and we will try to finish the tasks step by step in accordance with the deliverable handouts. 
A final event is going to take place as a presentation of this project and other similar ones taking place in the class of Advanced Python in the University of Bern’s main building in room 106 on the 1st of June 2023 at 14:15 – 16:00.
