<h1>Advanced Python project: Travel Planner</h1>
<p><b>Name</b>: TravelPlanner</p>
<p><b>Coders</b>: Balagopal Rajagopal, James Kai Groff Mizoguchi</p>
<p><b>Mission and summary</b>: Create a travel planner program to help users organize and plan their trips and eventual future ones for optimization.</p>

The following <b>milestones</b> are set as such for this project with the deadlines in italics:

1.	Project management – <i>April 27th, 2023</i>
2.	First deliverable; GitHub – <i>May 4th, 2023</i>
3.	Second deliverable; Classes; Refactoring – <i>May 11th ,2023</i>
4.	Third deliverable; Unit tests; Issues – <i>May 18th, 2023</i>
5.	Virtual environment – <i>May 25th, 2023</i>
6.	Presentation (in person and in class) – <i>June 1st, 2023</i>

It will be separated in those different <b>tasks</b>:

<b>Task 1 - Trip Details and Itinerary</b>
Allow users to input trip details, such as destination, dates, transportation, and accommodations. Users can also add activities or points of interest to their itinerary.

<b>Task 2 - Budget Management</b>
Enable users to input their trip budget and track expenses, such as accommodation costs, transportation, meals, and activities. Provide a way to view the remaining budget and suggest adjustments if necessary.

<b>Task 3 - Data Visualization and Trip Analysis</b>
Provide users with visualizations of their trip data, such as a timeline of planned activities or a breakdown of expenses by category. Allow users to analyse their travel patterns and budget usage to optimize future trips.

This is a weekly-based working program, so the <b>timeframe</b> for this project will be taken care of according to the deadlines of the milestones and we will try to finish the tasks step by step in accordance with the deliverable handouts. 

A <b>final event</b> is going to take place as a presentation of this project and other similar ones taking place in the class of Advanced Python in the University of Bern’s main building in room 106 on the 1st of June 2023 at 14:15 – 16:00.

This project will mainly use the programming language python as we are going to use many packages from the python environment such as Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, etc.

This roadmap can change in the future so stay tuned for updates of the project.
